	  <p>Manchester United by far is my favorite football team.</p>
	  <p>They play in Premier League which is the highest football league in England.</p>
	  <p>Manchester United has won numerous domestic and international titles, including 20 English Premier League titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 EFL Cups, and 3 UEFA Champions League titles.</p>
	  <p>The team plays its home matches at Old Trafford, a historic stadium located in Greater Manchester. It has a seating capacity of over 74,000 spectators, making it one of the largest football stadiums in the UK.</p>
	  <p>Noticible Rivals: Liverpool, Manchester City. Both of these teams have a lot of drama and excitement that they are named North West Derby and Manchester Derby</p>
